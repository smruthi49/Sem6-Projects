# Image Encryption using AES
This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data.

## Features
1. Encrypt an image file using AES algorithm
2. Decrypt an encrypted image file using AES algorithm
3. Support for various image formats

## Working
Given an input image, it reads the image, converts it into bytes and encodes the bytes to give the encrypted version. To decrypt it, the encoded bytes are passed to the decrypt function and the final image is obtained.
